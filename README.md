Bits and pieces of working and broken Excel workbooks

I believe that MS Excel is powerful but dangerous.  A wise person once observed
that BASIC encourages spaghetti code while C leads to ravioli code.  I'm not
sure what Excel encourages, but it has two fundamental flaws:
1) By offering such an approachable visual metaphor and such low barriers to 
entry, it empowers people with no training (and sometimes little intellectual
discipline) to construct models that at best are impossible for mortals to
decode, and at worst are bound to fail at the worst possible time;
2) There is no code base to review, audit, and learn from.  Data and code are
inextricably intertwined.  Too many Excel workbooks are a complete logical
and structural mess.

Yet, Excel is far too powerful a tool to ban from any analyst's toolbox.
